# Shopping list v.0.1.1


## Overview 

In this version of Shopping list we will add the following features:

* Generate a list of the days of the week with 2 recipes for each day.
* Sort each of theses recipes by:
            
    * Rating (favourite recipes recurring more often)
            
    * Preparation Time:

        * Lunch: Under a specfied time limit
        * Dinner: no time limit but doesn't repeat with lunch the same day/week.

## Weighted Random Selection

To go through all the recipes in our database, we need to proceed to a weighted random selection. 

In order to generate a weighted random selection, we first need to create a `weight` column and a `weighted_sum` column in the `recipes` table, then we have to assign a weight (based on rating) to each recipe.

Once they've been assigned, we sum all of them up and generate a random number r between 0 and the total `weighted_sum`, then we go through each element and subtract its `weight` from the `weighted_sum` until we reach 0. the last element that produces 0 is returned.

In order to implement this in a single query, we calculate a sum of all the weights proceeding and including each element Σwi in advance. Then we match a random number r between 0 and the `weighted_sum` to the minimal Σwi that is greater than r.

To write a query to select a random element based on its weight, we do as follows:

```
SELECT @random :=  RAND() * (SELECT MAX(weighted_sum) FROM recipes);
SELECT
  *
FROM 
  recipes
WHERE
  weighted_sum > @random
ORDER BY
  weighted_sum ASC , total_time ASC
LIMIT 14
```

The recipes with the least prep time and the most rating will have the most important weights.

## Dispaching the Recipes

Once the list of recipes has been generated, we will assign the ones with the smallest preparation time to the 'Lunch' category of each day leaving the remaining ones to be distributed in the 'Dinner' category of each day.

In the previous section, we ordered the results by ascending `weighted_sum` and ascending `total_time`. So the recipes will be arranged from smallest preparation time to longest. With this result, we only need to assign the first 7 recipes to 'Lunch' in and the last 7 ones to the 'Dinner' categories.

The final result will come in JSON format.
