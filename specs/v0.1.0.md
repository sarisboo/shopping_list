# Shopping list 

We spend a lot of time picking a recipe, testing it or trying to remember on which website/cookbook it was and when we are finally done collecting a list of recipes, we still have to list all the ingredients necessary to go grocery shopping in the right amounts. 

This project will provide the following features:

- Generate a `shopping_list` database and feed initial recipes to it.
- Create/Update/Delete/Read recipes and their ingredients.
- Rate recipes.
- Randomly suggest a list of recipes for the week.

What this project will provide in a future version:

- Adding new recipes to the database based on preferences.
- Once the recipes are approved by the user, generate a shopping list of all the ingredients needed to make them.

We will to create a SQLite database storing our favourite recipes and issue a selection of 10 recipes for the week via one REST API endpoint. The server will be implemented in Python 3.6.5.

## Project organization

### Poetry

We will use [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/) to structure our source code, manage dependencies, control the Python environment. `poetry` also offers a centralized way of executing several scripts like so: `poetry run <script>`.

We will provide the following scripts:

 - `api`: this module will hold the basic api code built with flask. 


### Packages

The project will be composed of the following packages:
 - `shopping_list`: Contains the code for the API that will generate the suggested recipes.
 - `tests`: Contain all the unit tests.
 - `models`: this package will hold our database models and marshmallow schemas.

## Database

### Schema

#### recipes
| Column        | Type   | Attributes    | Description |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| id            | `INT`  | `PRIMARY KEY` | recipe id |
| name          | `TEXT` | `NOT NULL`    | name of the recipe|
| rating        | `INT`  | `NOT NULL`    | grade of the recipe (max value is 5)|
| total_time    | `INT`  | `NOT NULL`    | preparation time + cooking time|
| ingredient_id | `INT`  | `FOREIGN KEY` | foreign key to the ingredients table|

#### recipe_ingredient (joining table)

| Column        | Type   | Attributes    | Description |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| recipe_id     |      `INT`  | `NOT NULL`        | `FOREIGN KEY` | to the recipes table |
| ingredient_id |      `INT`  | `NOT NULL`        | `FOREIGN KEY` | to the ingredients table |
| quantity    | `INT`  | `NOT NULL` | amount needed for this ingredient

#### ingredients

| Column        | Type   | Attributes    | Description |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| id            | `INT`  | `PRIMARY KEY` | ingredient id |
| name          | `TEXT` | `NOT NULL`    | name of the ingredient|

### Seeding

This will be done using SQLite DB Browser because we can perform tasks such as creating databases, searching them and editing the data in a more visual way.

In a future version we will provide a script to do that automatically.
For a start, we will add about 13 recipes to the database, the number of recipes will grow over time.

### Flask_SQLAlchemy

This is an ORM that allows us to create an SQLAlchemy database instance. This will provide a class named Model that can be used to declare models.

By creating SQLAlchemy classes, Weâ€™ll be able to connect the fields from the database table rows to behaviour, allowing us to interact with the data.

```
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from flask_marshmallow import Marshmallow
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
ma = Marshmallow(app)

class Recipe(db.Model):

    __tablename__ = 'recipes'
	id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
	name = db.Column(db.String)
    rating = db.Column(db.Integer)
    total_time = db.Column(db.Integer)
	ingredient_id = db.relationship('recipe_ingredients')
	def __repr__(self):
        return f'{self.recipe_name}'

```
### Marshmallow

It is a module that helps us create a `RecipeSchema` class for instance but instead of mapping database tables and field names to the class and its attributes, the `RecipeSchema` class defines how the attributes of a class will be converted into JSON-friendly formats.

```
class RecipeSchema(ma.ModelSchema):
    class Meta:
        model = Recipe
        sqla_session = db.session
```

With this class definition, we want to be able to serialise an instance of a `Recipe`class into JSON data, and to deserialise JSON data and create a `Recipe` class instances from it.

## API

The API will only have have one endpoint for now, which will be selecting the recipes randomly and providing the corresponding list of ingredients.
To build it, we will use the Flask-RESTful framework, the running web server comes with flask itself.

This library can be used to insert, select, update, and delete data from the database, for example here is how we would implement a simple GET endpoint to view the recipes detail by id:


```
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from flask_marshmallow import Marshmallow
import os

app = Flask(__name__)
basedir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///' + os.path.join(basedir, 'crud.sqlite')
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
ma = Marshmallow(app)

recipe_schema = RecipeSchema()

# endpoint to get recipe detail by id
@app.route("/recipes/recipe_detail/<id>", methods=["GET"])
def recipe_detail(id):
    recipes = db.engine.execute('select top 10 * name from recipes order by newid()')
    for recipe in recipes:
        return recipe_schema.jsonify(recipe)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
We can have the server show changes without restarting our application if we run it on debug mode.
Now we can call the API endoint using :

```
curl http://localhost:5000/recipes/recipe_detail/1
```

### Recipes suggestion

For now, we will randomly generate a list of about a dozen different recipes each time the endpoint is hit.
